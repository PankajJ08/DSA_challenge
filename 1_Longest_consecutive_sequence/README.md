# Longest Consecutive Sequence - Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Given an **unsorted array of integers**, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

- **Input**: An array of integers, e.g., `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`
- **Output**: Length of the longest consecutive element sequence, e.g., `4` (for the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).

### Constraints:
- Your algorithm must run in **O(n)** time complexity.
